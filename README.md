finally fixed after attempt 7 i dont understand how or why it stopped working in the first place but am now glad that it works seems like the issue was with maven it went to package the application and test it immediately without first cleaning the record so past errors built up and kept showing as well..

also the code review 2 was talking about adding some fourth badge am currently unsure as to what badge it is so will work on adding it later after figuring that out need to work on the sql now and add that other feature where the user can make their own sql statements to see other bits of data
